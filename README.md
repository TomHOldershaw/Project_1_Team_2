# Project 1 Team 2

The project looked at the performance of countries in the Olympic Games across time. A full project description is in "Olympic Medals (1896-2014).pdf", with the project report in "Olympic Medals - report.pdf"

We analysed three questions, in summary:
1. Which are the top performing countries in the Games
2. Who performs best at new events
3. What is the impact of being a Host country
